## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3
- **Storage**: IndexedDB for robust data persistence with automatic migration from Local Storage
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with CSS Variables for theming
- **Icons**: Unicode emojis for lightweight iconography
- **Responsive**: CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive layouts

### Database Architecture
ProjectFlow uses IndexedDB for client-side data storage, providing:
- **Structured Storage**: Separate object stores for projects and tasks
- **Indexing**: Efficient querying by status, priority, due date, and project relationships
- **ACID Transactions**: Reliable data operations with rollback capabilities
- **Large Storage Capacity**: Much larger storage limits compared to Local Storage
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Non-blocking database operations for better performance

#### Database Schema
```javascript
// Projects Object Store
{
  keyPath: 'id',
  indexes: ['status', 'dueDate', 'createdDate']
}

// Tasks Object Store
{
  keyPath: 'id',
  indexes: ['projectId', 'status', 'priority', 'dueDate', 'createdDate']
}
```

### Architecture

```

### Key Components
- **ProjectManager Class**: Main application controller
- **ProjectFlowDB Class**: IndexedDB database operations and management
- **Data Management**: IndexedDB with automatic migration from Local Storage
- **Data Management**: IndexedDB with automatic migration from Local Storage
- **Event Handling**: Comprehensive event listeners for user interactions
- **Theme System**: CSS custom properties for dark/light mode
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoints

### Data Migration
ProjectFlow automatically handles migration from Local Storage to IndexedDB:
1. **First Load**: Checks for existing IndexedDB data
2. **Migration Detection**: If no IndexedDB data exists, checks Local Storage
3. **Automatic Migration**: Transfers all projects and tasks to IndexedDB
4. **Cleanup**: Removes Local Storage data after successful migration
5. **Fallback**: Loads sample data if no existing data is found

### Data Structure
```javascript
// Project Object
{
  id: "proj-1",
  name: "Website Redesign",
  description: "Complete overhaul...",
  status: "active", // active, completed, on-hold
  dueDate: "2025-07-15",
  createdDate: "2025-06-01"
}

// Task Object
{
  id: "task-1",
  title: "Create wireframes",
  description: "Design wireframes...",
  projectId: "proj-1",
  priority: "high", // high, medium, low
  status: "completed", // todo, in-progress, completed
  dueDate: "2025-06-15",
  createdDate: "2025-06-01"
}
```
